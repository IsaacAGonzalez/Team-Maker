  ## Description
  This project is a two aspect project. Where one aspect is a commandline interface tool that takes in user data regarding information about their team and about those team members to create a database with information stored about each member given. This project also will have a visual aspect to it where the project will take that team member database and display the team members onto an HTML page for the user to see there team member's information on a visual HTML page along with the information provided for each member.

  ## Installation
  In order to install and use make sure to initiate using: 
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  This will ensure that everything is setup correctly and the dependancies needed are in place.

  ## Tests
  For testing purposes you can use the following command:
  ```
  npm test
  ```

  ## Usage
  This project uses Node to run and will ask the user to fill in information about their team. Once the user has completed the commandline inquirery, they will be able to visually see the info they submitted on a HTML page. To generate this page the project uses Express to create a local server where the HTML aspect uses its own scripts to create GET requests from the server to access the database created from the user's input. The data is then parsed within the frontend scripts to create the visual HTML page for the user to see their teams information.

  ## Contributing 
  This is a project I created while attending a bootcamp. It was made for educational purposes and to explore concepts such as GET and POST requests, running a local server with Express, using commandline tools with Node, and accessing databases for frontend development. Feel free to use this repository for learning or inspiration. Happy Hacking!
